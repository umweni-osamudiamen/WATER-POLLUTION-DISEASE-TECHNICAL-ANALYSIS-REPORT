# WATER-POLLUTION-DISEASE-TECHNICAL-ANALYSIS-REPORT
Objectives:

Water, is a vital element of life and good health, so it is pertinent to ensure that the water for consumption is clean and safe. In this analysis, I analysed data on water pollution disease, describing the water bodies commonly used and the method of purification that different countries’ populace use on their water.

This dataset was downloaded from Kaggle.com, an open online data source and the downloaded was transformed using Power BI Power Query. because the data was already, there were no cleaning carried but loaded, the data comprise row and column which was later splitted into dependent and independent data.

Project Split
Independent data: Country, Year, Region, Water source type, Water treatment method

Dependent data: Contaminant Level (ppm), pH Level, Turbidity (NTU), Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L), Nitrate Level (mg/L), Lead Concentration (Âµg/L), Bacteria Count (CFU/mL), Access to Clean Water (% of Population), Diarrhea Cases per 100,000 people, Cholera Cases per 100,000 people, Typhoid Cases per 100,000 people, Infant Mortality Rate (per 1,000 live births), GDP per Capita (USD), Healthcare Access Index (0–100), Urbanisation Rate (%), Sanitation Coverage (% of Population), Rainfall (mm per year), Temperature (Â°C), and Population Density (people per kmÂ²).

Industry Type: Health, Mineral Resources and Environment.

Stakeholders: Health practitioners, Government, Water Factory Executives, andConsumers.

Story of data: This data gives us insights into water pollution cases across the globe, for different countries and the region in them. As we hope to derive the most common water pollutant, most toxic, and the likes.

Industry Success: Providing pyogen-free water that is safe for consumer

In-Analysis Observation

Sum of GDP of all country is 150Million
Boiled water has bacteria count of 1.97Million why filtration method had bacteria count of 1.77Million making filtration more effective.
Percentage of population that had access to clean water is 194Million
Lead contamination is more in River water and lower in pond water
Spring water caused my typhoid cases 27K while pond caused lower number of typhoid case 23K.
More people 280.62K drink River water while 228.58K uses Pond Water.
Average pH level was 7.26
26% of people uses boiling as main water treatment method.
In-Analysis Recommendation

1. The sum of GDP of all countries is 150Million, efforts should be geared towards poverty eradication.

2. Boiled water has bacteria count of 1.97Million why filtration method had bacteria count of 1.77Million making filtration more effective, so filtration recommended for use over others like boiling.

3. Percentage of population that had access to clean water is 194Million, effort to improve access to clean water must be made.

4. Lead contamination is more in River water and lower in pond water, all source of lead must be reduced or ban were necessary.

5. Spring water caused my typhoid cases 27K while pond caused lower number of typhoid cases 23K, open defecation and cause water pollution must be strongly campaigned against.

6. More people 280.62K drink River water while 228.58K uses Pond Water, advise them all to use a safer water source.

7. Average pH level was 7.26 effort must be made to create a simple pH test for households.

8. 26% of people uses boiling as main water treatment method. Treatment method by boiling should improve by way increasing boiling time or temperature over longer period.

Order observation are per capita GDP 16 million, percentage of population that have access to clean water 21,000 average pH level 7.24.

Recommendations

1. Considering that filtration yielded the least bacteria count based on water treatment method, recommendation is that governments, water factory owners look into using more of it for purification of water while working on getting other method that will yield better result.
  
2. Since, only 194K people have access to clean water, recommendation is that purified water be subsidized to make it more affordable and possible purified water tank be provided for those in rural area.
   
3. Considering the large number of typhoid cases reported by most countries, it is recommended that strict laws be promulgated to put water pollution in check especially the natural water bodies since many people still use them.
 
4. Looking at the level of lead contamination it is recommended that the vehicular regulation on lead be enforced and sources be put in check.
   
5Food and Drug Regulation Agencies should educate people on the need to ensure that drink water only from certified sources not random water bodies.

6. Recommendation, the regulation bodies should put forward a more tested and trusted technique of purifying water not simple filtration, chlorination, boiling.
   
7. Recommendation; open defecation should be prohibited and people should discourage from doing it.

Conclusion:

From the observation in this analysis, it is important to note that many country’ citizen still water from water bodies that are not treated or purified, even those who attempt to purified use unconventional ways like basic boiling principle. Worthy of mention is the fact that lead a very toxic element was present in the water in high amount. Typhoid and Cholera cases per 100, 000 people are also in high concentration giving a clue to the level of poor hygiene being practiced.
Future research should consider other water sources like rain water, and provide more data, including moisture, ionic concentration.
